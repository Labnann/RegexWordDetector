# RegexWordDetector


My friend uses a chatbot that kicks out anyone who uses a particular pattern in their word selection. Typically a "Bad Word Filter". The chatbot is able to take regex. Since regex is a complex thing to write for a common user, this project builds the project for you.

\[Even Among US makes mistakes filtering these u.u]

Input: A word

Output: A Regex that:

  -> Matches pattern like this. input :test, sentence: "tesssstttttt test testing attest test." In this sentence "tesssstttttt" "test" "test." will be matched. But not   attest.
